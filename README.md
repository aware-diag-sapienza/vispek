## Abstract
Clustering is one of the most used techniques to derive insights from a dataset and usually it involves the exploration of a vast space of solutions, asking for high computational
resources, and looking for high-quality results. Among the available techniques, this paper focuses on k-means ensemble clustering, in which the user starts $r$ k-means runs using $r$ different seeds and selects the best result from the ensemble composed of the $r$ computed partitions. While this approach is mandatory for the standard k-means, because of the large variability of results generated by random seeds, this paper concludes that also the more accurate seeds generated by k-means++ produce a large result variability that can be profitably handled by an ensemble approach.
However,  in spite of the polynomial smoothed complexity of k-means, generating an ensemble may be a long-lasting activity also for not very large datasets, hindering an exploratory data analysis.
This paper contributes to this problem by proposing a progressive clustering technique that allows for engaging the user before the whole ensemble has been computed and provides a means for speeding up the whole process with controlled quality. This technique is the heart of a Progressive Visual Analytics system, namely VisPek that supports and informs the user along a progressive ensemble clustering activity, allowing for starting automatic and repetitive analyses,  exploring early results, and steering the whole process. The proposed solution is tested against two use cases and an expert evaluation, showing the advantages in terms of saved time and versatility of analysis.
